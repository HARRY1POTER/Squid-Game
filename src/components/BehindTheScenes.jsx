              <span className="font-bold text-white">Squid Game</span> was
              filmed in South Korea, utilizing real sets and visually stunning
              locations to create an immersive world of tension and intrigue.
              The production team meticulously designed each set to reflect the
              stark contrasts between the opulent world of the rich and the grim
              environment of the players.

              The games themselves were shot on large soundstages, with each set
              designed to look deceptively simple but intricately layered to
              represent the psychological pressure the players are under. From

              The <span className="font-bold text-white">Squid Game</span>{" "}
              costumes were carefully chosen to reflect the character's
              personalities and their class divide. The green tracksuits of the
              players represent uniformity and anonymity, while the guardsâ€™
              masks and uniforms symbolize the faceless authority controlling
              the deadly games. The distinctive shapes (circle, triangle,
              square) on the guardsâ€™ masks were designed to show the hierarchy
              of power within the game.

              Director Hwang Dong-hyuk drew inspiration from a variety of
              sources, blending traditional Korean culture with modern societal
              critiques. He wanted to explore the stark contrasts between the
              rich and the poor, using{" "}

              The casting was crucial to the showâ€™s success. The actors, led by
              Lee Jung-jae as Seong Gi-hun and Park Hae-soo as Cho Sang-woo,
              brought depth and authenticity to their roles, creating complex
              characters that audiences could root for or despise. Many of the
              actors were relatively unknown outside of Korea before the show,
